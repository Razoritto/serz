#Glow Sticks Configuration
#
#  This file contains the configuration for the Glow Sticks mod.
#  You can enable or disable features and adjust settings as needed.
#
#  Glow Stick Despawn:
#  - despawnEnabled: Enable or disable the automatic despawn of glow sticks.
#  - despawnTicks: Controls the aging probability of glow sticks during random ticks.
#    A value of 1 means every random tick has a 100% chance to age the glow stick.
#    A value of 2 means every random tick has a 50% chance to age the glow stick.
#    A value of 5 means every random tick has a 20% chance to age the glow stick.
#    Higher values make glow sticks last longer on average.
#    When a glow stick reaches age 15, it will despawn automatically.
#
#  Particle Effects (Client Side Only):
#  - spawnRandomParticles: Enable or disable random glow particles from placed glow sticks.
#  - randomParticleSpawnRate: How often random glow particles spawn (higher = less frequent). Default: 25
#  - spawnWaypointParticles: Enable waypoint particles when sneaking and holding a glow stick to show path to nearest matching glow stick.
#  - waypointSearchRadius: Horizontal radius in blocks to search for nearest glow stick. Default: 32
#  - waypointVerticalSearchRadius: Vertical radius in blocks to search for nearest glow stick. Default: 16
